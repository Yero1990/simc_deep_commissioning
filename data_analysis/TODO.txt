** Fix the z_target offset issue observed in data. Look at the
z_target variable calculated by HMS and compare it to that of SHMS.
They should be the same.  Also, determine whether this is a real offset
or is there something wrong in data that is causing this offset, for example,
a ytar / yptar offset. Once this is fixed, apply the proper vertex cuts to cut 
out the Al. target cell walls. We can also try looking at the Al. dummy data. 

** Estimate the background underneath the coincidence peak. Even though this
might be small, we still we to subtrack it when we determine the cross-sections.

** With respect to the resolution issues observed in Missin Mass and Missing
Energy, there is a flag in extra_hydrogen called: MC_smear_addl = TRUE, in
addition to adding the parameter for extra mult scatt in the input file. Try
a setting of 20 mr first.
