 Double_t ztarg=(ytar_off-beam_org(0)*(costheta-yptar*sintheta))/(-sintheta-yptar*costheta);
 v.SetXYZ(beam_org(0),beam_org(1),ztarg);
 Double_t ytar_off=theTrack->GetTY()+pointing_off(1);


** Fix the z_target offset issue observed in data. Look at the
z_target variable calculated by HMS and compare it to that of SHMS.
They should be the same.  Also, determine whether this is a real offset
or is there something wrong in data that is causing this offset, for example,
a ytar / yptar offset. Once this is fixed, apply the proper vertex cuts to cut 
out the Al. target cell walls. We can also try looking at the Al. dummy data. 

** Estimate the background underneath the coincidence peak. Even though this
might be small, we still we to subtrack it when we determine the cross-sections.

** With respect to the resolution issues observed in Missin Mass and Missing
Energy, there is a flag in extra_hydrogen called: MC_smear_addl = TRUE, in
addition to adding the parameter for extra mult scatt in the input file. Try
a setting of 20 mr first.

FIXING ZTARG Mismatch between HMS/SHMS
----------------------------------------
There is a mis-match between targz (HCS) as determined by HMS and SHMS. The general 
formula used in hcana is: 
 
   Double_t ztarg=(ytar_off-beam_org(0)*(costheta-yptar*sintheta))/(-sintheta-yptar*costheta);  (Also found on HMS_Optics notes)

The break down of the components is:
ytar_off:      ytar + y_mispointing (Spectrometer coordinates, --> +Y beam left, +X towards floor)
beam_org(0):    beam_org = fBeam->GetPosition();
                           fBeam->GetPosition() {return fPosition};
               In THcRaster:  fPosition[0].SetXYZ(-fXbpm_tar, fYbpm_tar, 0.0); ---> Then beam_org(0) = -fXbpm_tar (Hall Coordinates, due to the negative sign)

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       When *fXbpm_tar and fYbpm_tar* written to a tree, (XBPM at target is +X beam right, EPICS coordinates
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

yptar:  Reconstructed quantity in spectrometer coordinates --->  Double_t yptar = theTrack->GetTPhi();    **NOTE: This returns yptar before applying the yptar-offset (See THcHallCSpectrometer.cxx)

costheta:  ---> Double_t costheta=TMath::Cos(fSpectro->GetThetaSph());  
sintheta: --->  Double_t sintheta=TMath::Cos(fSpectro->GetPhiSph())*TMath::Sin(fSpectro->GetThetaSph());  
--> I dont know where is Phi Angle. I did not find it in param
--> There is a phi-offset however, fPhiOffset ("phi_offset") found in hmsflags.param (or shmsflags.param)

--> There is a theta_angle (Spectrometer Central Angle), 
--> There is also an fThetaOffset ("theta_offset")

*****************************************
My Ztarget Formula:  (December 18, 2018)
*****************************************
Starting from Jure's HMS Notes, his Ztarget formula was:

z_vert = [ ytar + xBPM * (cos (theta) + yptar*sin(theta) ) ] / [ sin(theta) - yptar*cos(theta) ],    xBPM must be in Hall Coordinat System (+X beam left)


Assuming HMS theta is NEGATIVE and SHMS theta is POSITIVE (from standard kinematics),  and using the property:  sin (-Angle) = -sin(Angle)

---> z_vert_hms = -[ hytar + xBPM * (cos (theta) - yptar*sin(theta) ) ] / [ -sin(theta) - yptar*cos(theta) ]

---> z_vert_shms = -[ eytar + xBPM * (cos (theta) + yptar*sin(theta) ) ] / [ sin(theta) - yptar*cos(theta) ]

**NOTE: I had to put an overall "-" sign in front, for it to match SIMC, as it was initially anti-symmetric


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

December 18, 2018 Continued . . . 

After fixing ztar, use my own formula for now. Then speak with Mark / Steve about the possibility of including it in hcana 

** Next, look at Al dummy data taken at these same kinematics
--->Unfortunately, the Al dummy was only taken at the H(e,e'p) elastics kinematics. Even though, the SHMS was kept fiexed. So it may be useful, since we
took single SHMS data. Currently replaying Al. Dummy Run 3255, to compare it with Pm = 80 MeV zTarget.
