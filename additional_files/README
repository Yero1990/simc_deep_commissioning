You can also download the laget file including the software that generates the binary version from:

Laget.tar.gz

In this directory you need to run: make -f make_binary_grid.mak to compile the converter.
After this is successful you need to run make_binary_grid to generate the binary versions.
After this you can use the data file.


In the input file, the grid.bin produced from Laget.tar.gz goes in data_file = './'
&THEORY_CTRL
    theory_par%model = 'LAGET_DEUT'       ! select a model name
    theory_par%data_file = './'           ! directory for the data file
    theory_par%FLAGS = 10*F             ! 10 flags are available
    theory_par%parameter(1) = 1         ! 1 do fsi, 0 do pwia
    theory_par%parameter(2) = 1         ! 1 do linear inter, 2 for log
    theory_par%parameter(3) = 1         ! 1 use binary files (fast), 0 ascii (slow)
